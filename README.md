<h1> My time throughout the course: </h1>

Throughout the course I learned a tremendous amount of knowledge and projects to still be continued. The learning experience brought a lot of significence throughout this training course as I developed fundamental knowledge on how the front end works and managed to help a lot of my knowledge in using the backend frameworks such as Asp.Net, C# and much more feature that I learned throughout the courses.
